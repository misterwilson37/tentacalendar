// ============================================================
// Tentacalendar — app.js
// Version 1.10.0 — PROJECT-TYPE LIBRARY (D124, a Y). The single stage
// template becomes a LIBRARY: a "Project type" picker on the new-project
// form snapshots the CHOSEN pipeline (Default = the old stageTemplate, or
// any named type) via the existing addProjectWithStages — zero creation-path
// risk. Settings ▸ Pipeline gains a #pipeline-target selector + New/Rename/
// Delete; the one stage editor now edits whichever pipeline is selected,
// held in an in-memory draft that switch-syncs so unsaved edits survive a
// hop, and Save persists Default → saveStageTemplate and the rest →
// saveProjectTypes. Existing projects keep their own snapshot; nothing
// migrates. The holiday-card pipeline Jake wanted is now just a type he
// builds once and picks — the bridge toward types beyond Katie's default.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 1.9.0 — HOLIDAYS ON THE WALL AND THE WEEK (D123, a Y). A per-device
// "★ Holidays" toggle (new Overlay group in BOTH the year and week .view-ctls,
// the D104 grammar) overlays US federal holidays, computed client-side in
// queue.js (holidaysForRange). Three surfaces, one shared preference
// (tc-holidays, default OFF): the year GRID/wall marks the day cell (accent
// dot + the holiday name in its title); the year TIMELINE drops an accent tick
// in the day-texture loop (title on hover); the week DAY-HEADS gain a small
// labelled line (abbr) with the full name in the head's title. holidayMapFor()
// caches per render window so the same Map serves every surface. No new data,
// no calendar sharing, works offline — D75's "gated behind integration" is moot.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 1.8.0 — THE NOW BAR (D122, the Y) + THE PARADE GETS A NAME
// (D121). D122, Katie's ask: the top of the Projects list carries a bar
// showing the CURRENT project and how long she's been on it — project
// color on the edge, name, "since 2:14 PM", and a live H:MM:SS second
// hand (a 1-second interval that touches ONE text node, never render()).
// Tap it → the clock-out dialog. It only exists while a timer runs, and
// it rides the 🗂 pane reparenting to the wall for free. ALSO the D119
// finish: the 🕰 was still a full-size .icon-btn wrapping onto its own
// row ("the same size it was before the move" — Jake); it now wears
// .clock-btn like its siblings, and all three clock controls live in one
// .clock-cluster that right-aligns and wraps as a UNIT, never the 🕰
// alone. D121: onStageToggle hands the project's NAME to celebrate(3)
// for the ticker-tape banner (celebrate.js 0.2.0 — the parade itself
// lives there).
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 1.7.0 — THE YEAR EXPANDS ON CLICK (D117, a Y) + the clock slims
// down (D119) + three modals escape drift-wrap (D118). D117: Jake's actual
// ask, decoded — the hover title was always fine; he wanted the WEEK
// strip's answer in the year: click a tight bar → it opens to readable
// height WITH its name (several at once, unlike hover), click again →
// back. Same session-only Set discipline as weekExpanded, cleared on size
// change; D115's click-popover AND its ±5px hitbox are retired at Jake's
// call ("I can see how those overlapping fields would complicate things").
// D118: clock/followup/yv-project modals lived INSIDE #drift-wrap, whose
// transform re-roots position:fixed to the PAGE box — scrolled down, a
// "centered" modal floated above the viewport (Jake's clock-out bug).
// They join the other six outside, where D37's rule always said overlays
// live. D119: the clock controls ride the dates/weight line now — ⏱ in /
// ⏹ elapsed, Σ, 🕰 — a whole row of vertical space returned to the cards.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 1.6.0 — UNDO EVERYWHERE IT'S WELL-DEFINED, PLUS REDO (D116) — a Y.
// Jake: "undo is always good, as is redo." Two stacks now; every entry
// carries both directions, captured at commit time; Ctrl/Cmd-Z undoes,
// Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-Z or Ctrl-Y redoes; a new action kills the redo stack
// (the old future is gone). Covered: task edits, task deletes (SAME-ID
// resurrection via restoreDoc so parentTaskId chains survive), due-date
// saves AND clears (task + stage), stage-editor saves (whole-array swap),
// project edits, year-bar drags, estimate drags, and all three clock ops
// (in / out / manual log — store returns what it touched). EXCLUDED on
// principle, argued and accepted: completion toggles — celebrations,
// follow-up materialization, and cactus spawns hang off them, and the
// D53 uncheck modal is already the better undo. Multi-user honesty: undo
// restores YOUR before-state; a mid-flight edit by the other person loses.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 1.5.0 — UNDO + the all-nighter + the tap toggle (D113/D114/D115).
// D114 (the Y): Ctrl/Cmd-Z undoes drag commits — year-bar moves/stretches
// and clock-estimate grips capture their before-state and restore through
// normal store writes (both screens see it); native undo in text fields
// untouched; stack of 30. D113: the clock dialogs ask WHEN with a full
// datetime-local — Katie's all-nighters and multi-day forgets are one
// honest field; the yesterday-guessing helper is deleted. D115: tapping a
// year bar a second time closes its popover, and every bar carries an
// invisible ±5px vertical hitbox — a 2px hairline is a statement, not a
// tap target; "tap for details" is now true at every size.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 1.4.0 — THE CLOCK (D112) — a Y. Katie's billable-hours paper,
// replaced. Fixed-price projects billed on assumed hours; the ledger's job
// is next year's ask. Every project card (Today view AND the dashboard's
// 🗂 pane — same reparented DOM, zero extra work) wears a clock row that
// survives collapse: ⏱ Clock in / ⏹ elapsed, a lifetime Σ, and 🕰 manual
// log. Jake's three sentences, implemented as written: clock-in on B while
// A runs is a SILENT switch (one batched commit closes A and opens B at
// the same instant — one open session max, by construction); clock-out
// opens a dialog with an editable end time (the "actually I stopped at
// 2:30" guesstimate) and Cancel (the misclick eraser); 🕰 logs a backdated
// session and truncates an overlapping running timer where it starts.
// Cross-midnight times mean yesterday; ends clamp to now and to their own
// starts. The rules wildcard already covers the sessions collection — no
// console re-paste.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 1.3.0 — THE CHRISTMAS CACTUS (D111) — a Y. Recurring, checkable
// tasks, exactly as specced in §5c with every decision already captured:
// a task may carry recurrence {every, unit, anchor}; checking it off lands
// it in Done-today AND materializes the next occurrence (a full new task,
// recurrence included — the cactus keeps needing water). Anchor default =
// completion ("you just watered it → 3 weeks from now"), per-task toggle
// for schedule-anchored. spawnedNextAt guards against double-planting on
// re-checks; un-checking leaves the spawn (simplest honest, follow-ups'
// own words). Escalation still nags the CURRENT instance only. The unit
// ladder is harmonized everywhere per Jake's aside ("a century-later
// follow-up feels amusing"): recurrence + escalation get calendar-correct
// months/years/decades/centuries; follow-up offsets get day-average
// equivalents. Queue rows wear ↻. Amends D20 narrowly — this is a task
// that re-plants itself, not a GCal-style engine.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 1.2.1 — TWO D105 WOUNDS (D110) — a Z. (1) Boot with "dash"
// persisted skipped enterDash(): S.view already read "dash" from
// localStorage, so the flag-based wasDash was true and the panes never
// assembled — flags flipped, week-view showed under a lit 🐙. setView now
// derives assembly from the DOM (dashHomes.length): boot-safe, idempotent,
// self-healing. (2) renderYear()'s pre-dashboard guard (S.view !== "year")
// silently refused every repaint of the year PANE — buttons fired, state
// changed, nothing drew; the pane was a frozen snapshot of the last solo
// render. Guard now admits "dash". Lesson for the ship-check: verifying
// the fan-out CALLS renderYear is not verifying the callee AGREES —
// called ≠ willing. Plus: a divider pointerdown mid-drag no longer
// double-increments the gesture lock.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 1.2.0 — THE BIG HURRAH GOES WHERE IT BELONGS (D109) — a Y. Katie
// finished the REAL climax of a project today (publishing) and the app
// saved the fireworks for the follow-up stage, because "last stage = the
// end" was a wrong model of what a project's end IS. Stages can now carry
// 🎆 (one per project, set in either stage editor; radio behavior; carried
// into next-year duplicates with checkmarks reset — the honor persists).
// A 🎆 stage completing = full level 3, fireworks + the wave, even with
// follow-ups open; the actual last stage then gets an ordinary level 2.
// No 🎆 marked = the old last-stage rule, unchanged. The Duplicate-next-
// year offer still waits for the WHOLE pipeline (that part really is
// about being done). Firestore never sees hurrah:false — true or absent.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 1.1.1 — the dashboard's ⛶ (D108) — a Z. Every view carried its
// own fullscreen button except the one that lives on a TV. The dashboard
// has no nav row, so the header IS its chrome: #hdr-fullscreen sits by ⚙️,
// dash-only, wired to the shared D96 toggle. (The pane ⛶ buttons always
// fullscreened the whole wall — but that shouldn't be a thing you have to
// know.)
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 1.1.0 — BURN-IN CARE (D107, a Y) + the strip-overflow fix (D106,
// riding along). D107, three per-device layers for a wall that runs 15h/day:
// screen REST during the sleep hours the app already knows (near-black +
// wandering clock, dashboard only, tap to peek 5 min); idle CHROME DIM
// (header + dividers fade to 35% after 5 quiet minutes); and a second,
// wider, ~26-minute drift orbit on top of D37's fast ±2px. D106: BAR_PX
// modeled bars as fixed pixels, but real height is rem padding + vw-clamped
// fonts, and vw measures the GLASS, not the pane — on the 4K dashboard the
// model undershot ~50% and Auto hid two bars behind a scrollbar at every
// split position. D103 made the budget measured; settleWeekBars() finishes
// the cost side: the model proposes a size, the layout disposes — overflow
// steps down a rung until it fits (pins stay honest clipping).
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 1.0.0 — THE DASHBOARD (D105, Phase 4) — the X. D67 defined it two
// months ago: "1.0 ships when the big-screen dashboard layout exists." It
// exists: a fourth view (🐙, ≥1200px glass only — Jake: "a 4K beast of a
// screen") that shows year LEFT, week TOP-RIGHT, agenda BOTTOM-RIGHT, all
// live at once, with draggable pane dividers (persisted per device,
// dbl-click resets) and a 🗂 toggle that splits the agenda pane two-up with
// the project pipeline. Architecture: the D68 reparenting trick at kiosk
// scale — the panes are EMPTY SHELLS and entering the dashboard MOVES the
// real #year-view/#week-view/#queue-panel into them (comment markers hold
// their seats at home). Nothing is cloned, so nothing can drift (D98). One
// new helper, fitAvail(), teaches all three height fits to answer against
// the pane when inside one and the window otherwise — the solo views are
// untouched by construction. Divider drags take the D101 gesture lock.
// Per Jake: from here, fixes are 1.0.z; only a new idea makes 1.1.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 0.38.1 — one grammar, and a splitter that answers (D104) — a Z.
// The week and year controls said the same three things in two dialects
// (labels/order/attributes all drifted); both now speak Layout · Window ·
// Bars with data-layout / data-window / data-size, ahead of the dashboard
// where the two headers must live side by side. localStorage keys are
// UNCHANGED on purpose — renaming them would silently reset Jake's and
// Katie's device choices, which reads as a bug. And the wv-split drag-DOWN
// deadness is fixed: Auto re-picks the bar size DURING the drag, so the
// boundary follows the pointer instead of teleporting on release.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// Version 0.38.0 — the tracks fix (D103) — a Z. Two bugs, one wound: the
// week's SEVEN columns were only ever declared in the stylesheet, so any JS
// that set grid-template-columns on #wv-grid alone silently divorced the
// day heads (.wv-strip) from the days. Tidal's past-column compression did
// exactly that. Tracks are now ONE CSS variable that #wv-grid and every
// strip read together — they cannot disagree, because there's one number.
// Also: Auto's budget was fiction. It modelled the strip box as 34% of the
// board, but my own #tidal-horizon (flex: 0 0 auto — it will NOT shrink)
// squeezes #wv-strips (flex: 0 1 auto — it will), and the banner rows share
// that box and were never counted. Auto now measures what's actually left.
// 0.37.0 — the gesture lock (D101) — a Y: deferred rendering is a
// thing that didn't exist before. render() is a SNAPSHOT handler, so a drag
// must DEFER renders, never drop them: skipping would silently discard
// Katie's live updates. Defer + flush on release, with a 30s safety valve
// that fails OPEN, because a stuck lock would freeze live sync while looking
// perfectly healthy — the worst failure this app can have.
// 0.36.0 — THE CLOCK GRID (D100), layout #3 under Week. Built on D93,
// NOT D91: a task time is a DUE date, so a task is the block
// [due - estimate, due] — the runway ENDS at the promise and trails BACKWARD.
// Only overdue runs forward. Events own [start, end] outright.
// Dragging a task's TOP edge IS estimating (D93), and that gesture is the
// point of the layout: "can I fit dinner on Tuesday?" is a question about
// LENGTH, and until now a task could only ever be a line at a deadline.
// 0.35.1 — dead-space fix (D99). A past column whose items are all
// done/moved has an EMPTY .wv-list, and .wv-list is flex:1 — so the empty box
// claimed the whole column and stranded the cards at the bottom under a field
// of nothing. The bug only showed on exactly the columns reflection exists
// for. Now: no items + cards → the cards ARE the column.
// 0.35.0 — GANTESQUE IS DONE (D98). The 5a-bis victories/put-offs
// cards now render in GANTESQUE, which is where they were always owed —
// D97 built them and scoped them to Tidal, leaving the 12-turn-old Gantesque
// debt still open AND making the two layouts un-comparable, which is the one
// thing Tidal exists for. The cards are layout-agnostic: reflectionCards()
// is shared, the engine is dayReflection() in queue.js, and each layout only
// decides WHERE to hang them. Gantesque keeps its day list and gains the
// cards beneath it; Tidal REPLACES the list with a Wake. That difference is
// now the actual thing being compared.
// 0.34.0 — the Tidal Grid + Reflection (D97) — a Y: two things
// exist that didn't before. (1) THE CARDS 5a-bis promised and D95 built the
// data for, which nobody had actually rendered: what a day got DONE and what
// it put off. (2) TIDAL, layout #2 under Week (D90: Gantesque is the LAYOUT,
// the view stays "Week") — anchor shelf (events: fixed time, not ours) over
// the flow (tasks + stages: ours to arrange), and past days become a Wake.
// The two are one engine: the Wake IS the put-offs card.
// Gantesque is untouched — renderWeekColumns() is the 0.33.0 code verbatim,
// and it hands the grid tracks back to the stylesheet so Tidal's computed
// column widths can't leak into it.
// COST ON THE RECORD: the anchor/flow split breaks D43's chronological
// interleave (a 9 AM task sits below a noon meeting). That's the thesis —
// events own time, tasks own a deadline (D93) — and why it's a sibling.
// 0.33.0 — "on the wall" (D96) — a Y: Today had no ⛶ at all.
// 0.33.0: one shared toggleFullscreen() for all three views (week and
// year each had their own copy — which is how Today got forgotten), with
// webkit* fallbacks because the target is an OLD Android tablet: year's
// copy would have THROWN there, week's would have failed silently.
// Pairs with manifest.json (html 0.25.0): Add to Home Screen kills the
// address bar, ⛶ kills the rest, and Android screen-pinning locks it
// down needing nothing from us.
// Version 0.32.0 — "it remembers being moved" (D95) — a Y: this is new.
// 0.32.0: tasks carry firstDueAt + rescheduleCount (store 0.10.0). The
// hover shows "↻ moved 4× · first due Jul 10"; anything moved 3+ times
// wears a quiet mark, because a task that keeps sliding is the question
// worth asking. No migration — firstDueAt ?? dueAt IS the backfill.
// Version 0.31.1 — "spend the glass" (D94) — a Z, not a Y (D94 rule):
// old ideas finally behaving, not new ones. Draggable projects/days
// split (double-click resets); Auto now refits the bars into whatever
// share you chose instead of assuming a third. Row time+title finally
// share a centre line.
// Version 0.31.0 — "click to read, click to fold" (D92)
// 0.31.0: D91 expanded a bar on click and left no way back (Jake). Now
// one rule, no timing: at compact sizes a click TOGGLES expand/collapse
// and the expanded bar grows a ✎ to act; at readable sizes a click acts
// directly. "If you can read it, clicking acts; if you can't, clicking
// makes it readable." The hover says which one you'll get.
// Version 0.30.0 — "the board actually makes room" (D91)
// 0.30.0: D90's density edit NEVER LANDED — my patch script built a list
// of replacements, applied three by hand and never iterated the list, so
// weekBarSize/setWeekSize were called but never defined and dataset.size
// was never set. node --check parses; it does not notice a call to a
// function nobody wrote. Jake found it in one click. Now: the functions
// exist, Auto is HEIGHT-aware (measure the board, give the columns ~60%),
// and #week-view is pinned to the space under the header — height:100%
// against a parent with no height resolved to auto, which is why the
// columns walked off the bottom. First click on a too-small bar expands
// it; the second acts.
// Version 0.29.0 — "the board makes room" (D90)
// 0.29.0: HEIGHT. Eleven project bars pushed the day columns off the
// screen — #wv-sizes (Auto/▮/▪/▁/🧵) thins them, Auto stepping down as
// the list grows so the columns always get room. Banners pack DENSE (a
// 2-event Friday was taking a 3rd row because CSS grid's sparse cursor
// never walks backward — Jake and Katie both spotted the wasted row).
// Rows are clickable → reschedule; the deadline block finally hovers
// (I had written its tooltip and then killed it with pointer-events:
// none). NAV-SLOTS in all three views: "back to now" sits on the side
// matching its direction of travel and the arrows NEVER move — three
// clicks forward is three clicks forward (Jake, app-wide design flag).
// Version 0.28.0 — "Gantesque" (D89) — Jake's five, from real data
// 0.28.0: (1) project bars sort by PRIORITY, not the alphabet. (2) dates
// get a header row ABOVE the strips, where a date is expected. (3) the
// load bar is GONE: it showed "this day has 40% as many items as the
// busiest day" while looking exactly like a progress bar — two items,
// none done, 40% red, and Jake rightly asked what it meant. Words now.
// (4) the view toggle is a labeled 3-way switch (a glyph that needs a
// hover to explain itself is a failed control). (5) week-start modes:
// Today+6 / Sun–Sat / Mon–Sun, remembered per device — the past columns
// are for reflection, not waste (Jake corrected me). Also: an EXPIRED
// project whose window has passed no longer vanishes from the board.
// Version 0.27.0 — "the week" (D88)
// 0.27.0: THIRD VIEW. day → week → year cycles on one button. The week is
// seven QUEUE columns, not a clock: a task due at 4 PM is a deadline, not
// an appointment, and every computed stage deadline lands at deadlineHour,
// so a time grid would paint a wall of 4 PM collisions that don't exist.
// Spans (projects w/ stage pips, all-day events) ride the top strips;
// dated things live in columns. Per-day LOAD BAR — the one thing a week
// says that a day can't: "Thursday is going to hurt, and it's Monday."
// Rolling today+6 by default (a kiosk shouldn't spend four columns on
// history every Friday); ◀ ▶ page, "back to now" returns to rolling.
// Read-only v1 — drag lands once the layout is proven. queue ?v= → 0.13.0.
// Version 0.26.0 — "clear the deck, grouped" (D86)
// 0.26.0: queue ?v= → 0.12.0. D85's blended weight made a U (a 30%-done
// project outranked a 65%-done one); D86 replaces it with two piles —
// past-threshold beats catch-up, always. No UI change: same ⚙️ Pipeline
// setting, same fraction, better sort.
// Version 0.25.0 — "clear the deck" (D85)
// 0.25.0: new ⚙️ Pipeline setting — "Clear-the-deck at N% complete"
// (#cfg-cleardeck, stored as clearDeckThreshold fraction). Below it the
// queue favors your least-finished projects; at/above it a project flips
// to "just finish it." Wired to queue.js via setClearDeckThreshold on the
// config subscription (same pattern as deadlineHour). Tiebreaker only.
// Version 0.24.0 — "kick it down the road" (D84)
// 0.24.0: Jake's revised decision — the decision modal now offers BOTH
// reschedules: 🕐 stays the one-tap next-working-day-9AM, and a new 📅
// opens the due dialog for "way down the road" (any date + time). The
// due dialog is generalized: S.dueTarget is now {kind:"stage"|"task",…}
// and dueSave/dueClear branch — clearing a task's due shelves it to
// Waiting (a legit third option: 'not now, maybe ever').
// Version 0.23.1 — "the clock says where" (D83)
// 0.23.1: decision-modal rows now SAY the 🕐 plan in the sub line
// ("🕐 → Mon, Jul 13 9 AM") instead of hiding it in a hover tooltip —
// phones have no hover, and Jake read the silent auto-reschedule as
// "the modal just closes." Behavior unchanged: 🕐 IS the reschedule.
// Version 0.23.0 — "time passes, follow-ups flex" (D82, Otto's finale)
// 0.23.0:
//  · Passed timed events sink into an EARLIER TODAY box (dimmed,
//    struck time) instead of loitering in the live queue — today's
//    view only; past/future days show everything in place.
//  · Follow-ups get a real dialog (two prompt()s retired) with an
//    amount + minutes/hours/days/weeks unit. Storage stays offsetDays
//    (fractional — store.js's materialization already multiplies), so
//    store.js is untouched. Waiting rows display "+45m/+2h/+3d/+1w".
// Version 0.22.0 — "the mirror has a home" (D81)
// 0.22.0: ⚙️ Settings → Calendar gains "Mirror tasks to calendar ID"
// (config.mirrorCalendarId), consumed by functions 0.2.0's hourly
// reconcile. Blank = off. The function refuses polled calendars
// (loop guard); the hint says so too.
// Version 0.21.0 — "things that are happening" (D80)
// 0.21.0:
//  · All-day events render as an ambient BANNER STRIP above the queue
//    (tier-tinted pills, "Zoo Camp · day 3/5"), not as 12:00 AM rows —
//    the shape Jake described: not tasks, not appointments, just truth
//    to glance at. No checkbox, no pin, no expiry; multi-days show
//    their span; hover shows the full date range. Timed events remain
//    queue anchors exactly as designed since D3.
// Version 0.20.0 — "phone chrome" (D78)
// 0.20.0:
//  · ＋ in the header (phone widths only) scrolls straight to the
//    Add-a-task form and focuses the title (keyboard up, ready to
//    type). If you're in the year view it swaps to Today first — the
//    form lives there. No modal, per Jake: just the shortcut.
//  · "Log out", in words, at the very bottom (phone only); the ⏻
//    mystery-square hides at those widths.
// Version 0.19.2 — "the ghost is the preview" (D77)
// 0.19.2 (Jake: "it ends up where it's supposed to, but it strays
// into May first"):
//  · The pointer-following chip RETIRES. During a drag the original
//    bar dims in place; the ghosts — now TINTED in the project's own
//    color — are the entire moving preview. Nothing strays anywhere;
//    the transform/width preview code (source of two rounds of visual
//    bugs) is deleted outright.
// Version 0.19.1 — "the resolver learns left from right" (D76)
// 0.19.1 (BUGFIX, Jake's mid-drag screenshot):
//  · D73's date resolver measured only VERTICAL distance to rows — but
//    D72 put three months side-by-side, so April's week row "won" for
//    pointers inside June (same y-band, DOM order), x clamped to
//    April's edge, and EVERY horizontal position resolved to the same
//    date → horizontal drags dead, vertical ±7s fine. Now true 2D
//    distance; inside a rect is distance zero for that rect alone.
//  · Ghosts clipped to weeks but not MONTHS, so a shared spillover
//    week (May 31–Jun 6 lives in both May's and June's blocks) lit up
//    twice. Lanes now carry data-clip-s/e; ghosts draw only where the
//    bar will actually render.
// Version 0.19.0 — "the ghost knows where it lands" (D74)
// 0.19.0:
//  · DROP GHOSTS: while dragging, dashed accent slots render at body
//    level in EVERY row the new dates cross — the landing zone is
//    visible truth, matching the nav label. The lifted chip still
//    follows the pointer; the ghost is where it lands. Ghosts survive
//    mid-drag re-renders (they're body-level fixed, and the rowMap
//    rects remain valid).
// Version 0.18.0 — "carry it anywhere" (D73)
// 0.18.0:
//  · CROSS-ROW DRAGGING: drags hit-test against every week/row
//    rectangle (captured at grab time), so "what date is under the
//    pointer" replaces horizontal pixel math. Move a bar from the 12th
//    up a row to the 5th, across months, or between Gantt quarters —
//    the bar lifts and follows the pointer; the nav label reads live
//    dates; release commits with the usual working-day snapping.
//    Edge-drags use the same date math (width preview stays in-row;
//    the label guides).
// Version 0.17.0 — "Katie's quarters" (D72)
// 0.17.0:
//  · The Annual is QUARTERS: 4 rows × 3 months (Katie caught the 3×4
//    orientation error). Wider months serve the future kiosk column.
//  · PER-QUARTER uniform week heights (Jake's idea): each row of
//    months sizes to ITS OWN max weekly concurrency — July's 9-project
//    pileup only taxes Q3; empty quarters collapse. Fit math solves GL
//    across the actual quarter mix, so today's load lands ~6px bars in
//    a NORMAL window (fullscreen no longer required).
// Version 0.16.0 — "nickel and dime" (D71)
// 0.16.0:
//  · Annual reclaims its pixels: dow row dropped (weekend shading +
//    day numbers carry the structure), month chrome estimate honest
//    (26px), lane padding trimmed, auto floor now GL 3 → 2px hairline
//    bars. Jake's real numbers (≈1070px, 10 lanes, 6-week Aug) now
//    land at GL 3 with ~145px slack; ⛶ fullscreen buys GL 4.
//  · FIT-MATH BUG: measurements were viewport-space, so rendering
//    while scrolled inflated avail and bars GREW after you scrolled.
//    Now document-space (rect.top + scrollY) in Annual AND timeline.
//  · 🧵 hairline pin (LANE 3 / BAR 2, borderless): see the whole year
//    as color threads; tap for details; edit at bigger sizes.
//  · ⛶ fullscreen toggle in the year nav; fullscreenchange re-fits.
// Version 0.15.0 — "the year that fits" (D70)
// 0.15.0:
//  · Annual view (né Year wall) auto-density is now WINDOW-FIT, like
//    the timeline: month rows share the real screen height, GL clamps
//    5–14; the floor is 3px borderless hairline bars, so a fully
//    loaded Katie-year still fits one screen before it ever scrolls.
//    (Column count mirrors the CSS breakpoints — change together.)
//  · Annual week heights are UNIFORM (global max concurrency), so the
//    12 calendars line up like a real wall instead of July towering
//    over an empty August (Jake). Stacked Months keeps per-week fit.
//  · Bar labels appear on ANY bar tall enough to hold them (≥16px and
//    ≥3 days) — the Annual view included, e.g. with ▮ pinned.
//  · NOT a bug, recorded for posterity: progress fill is positional in
//    time (D30a) — a May–July project at 25% shows its saturation in
//    MAY; a July-onward window shows only ghost. Jan–Dec reveals it.
// Version 0.14.0 — "the whole year on the wall" (D69)
// 0.14.0:
//  · YEAR WALL layout (the view Jake was picturing all along): 12 mini
//    month calendars in a 4×3 grid — the wall of calendars. New
//    default; ▦▦/▦/▬ toggle. Zooming a wall month renders it big
//    (stacked-month styling). Wall bars never carry inline labels —
//    hover/tap/legend speak. Wall auto-density runs one notch thinner.
//  · BAR SIZE control (Jake): Auto (per-layout judgment, incl. the
//    timeline's window fit) or pinned ▮ 20px / ▪ 10px / ▁ 5px bars —
//    persisted per device (tc-year-barsize).
// Version 0.13.0 — "the wall calendar" (D68)
// 0.13.0:
//  · MONTH-GRID layout (Jake's "traditional view"): months stacked,
//    Sun–Sat columns, weeks as rows; bars clip per week ∩ month with
//    per-week lane packing (gcal-style), same drag/stretch/tap/fill.
//    Toggle (▦ Month grid ⇄ ▬ Timeline) left of the mode buttons;
//    grid is the default, choice persists (tc-year-layout). The
//    days-in-a-row layout now has its name in the UI: a Gantt chart.
//  · Timeline bars size to the WINDOW: total lanes share the real
//    vertical space (clamped 9–34px lanes), re-flowing on resize —
//    2K gets thick bars, phones get readable slivers.
//  · ＋ New project FAB (bottom-right of the year view) reparents the
//    REAL project form into a modal — listeners, color assistant, and
//    working-day interception ride along — and returns it on close.
// Version 0.12.0 — "days are key" (D66)
// 0.12.0:
//  · Day texture in BOTH year rows and month zoom: weekend shading
//    blocks, faint day gridlines, stronger Monday week lines (month
//    boundaries remain strongest). Compact grids shed day lines first.
//  · Adaptive bar density for Katie's real concurrency: ≤4 lanes =
//    full 20px bars with inline labels; ≤9 = half-height 10px; beyond
//    = quarter-height 5px. Thin bars drop inline labels — hover titles,
//    tap popovers, and the legend carry the names (Jake's suggestion).
//  · Rows now size to the lanes they actually use (a quiet quarter is
//    a short quarter) while every project keeps its one global lane.
// Version 0.11.0 — "PHASE 2: the year view" (D65)
// 0.11.0:
//  · Header 📅 toggles between Today and a quarter-aligned year view:
//    4 rows × 3 months, three anchor modes (Jan–Dec / quarter-first /
//    month-first, D31), ◀▶ pages 12 months, "back to now" resets.
//  · Project bars (D30a): pale ghost of the project color saturating
//    left-to-right by pipeline %, continuous across quarter rows via
//    per-segment gradient clipping; global lane packing keeps each
//    project on ONE lane all year; today line; legend + tap-for-details
//    popover (D27); labels hide on narrow grids (container query).
//  · Drag to move, edge-drag to stretch (D32): document-level pointer
//    listeners survive re-renders; live date readout in the nav label;
//    release snaps to the tier's working days (start fwd / end back,
//    order-guarded — same rules as the form and 🔁 duplicate).
//  · Tap a month name to zoom it full-width with day ticks (D18);
//    ◀▶ then steps one month; "◱ whole year" returns.
//  · View + anchor mode persist per device (tc-view / tc-year-mode).
// Version 0.10.0 — "the encore" (Katie's notes field, D63)
// 0.10.0:
//  · Tasks get an optional NOTES field: short title in the row, details
//    behind a ▸ toggle underneath (tap the title or the chevron).
//  · Row layout v2 (the phone smoking-gun screenshot): queue/waiting/
//    done rows are now two lines — [checkbox + title] over [tier chip +
//    actions] — so long titles wrap as prose instead of one-word
//    columns squeezed beside four buttons. Shared rowScaffold builder.
// Version 0.9.0 — "the goodbye release" (Inky's last)
// 0.9.0:
//  · D62 rev: dup modal gains "✎⋮ Review the pipeline first…" — edits
//    next year's stage list BEFORE anything is created (stages editor
//    borrowed via the "@dup" target; dup modal hides and returns).
//  · Snooze row: remind me in 1 day / 1 week / 1 month (30d alone was
//    too blunt).
//  · Un-dater broadened: remnants come in TWO flavors — after/end/0
//    (Katie's window experiments) AND after/start/0 (the 0.6.0/0.6.1
//    editors' default, per the D50 caveat). v0.8.0 only caught "end";
//    Jake's screenshot showed the other half untouched. Now any
//    After + 0wd row converts, either anchor.
// Version 0.8.0 — "the smoke-test release"
// 0.8.0:
//  · D61: queue hides a tier's items on days outside its allowedDays
//    (Katie's weekend queue is clear of Work; cards still show all).
//  · D62: duplicate-for-next-year is a REVIEW FORM — name (with the
//    year token auto-bumped, e.g. resv2606 → resv2706), dates, color,
//    tier, workload all editable before creation; "Remind me in a
//    month" snoozes it into a real task instead.
//  · Date/time fields: task due defaults to today; clicking any
//    date/time input opens the native picker (showPicker) where the
//    browser supports it, instead of demanding the tiny icon.
//  · Stage-editor rows: undated stages now GHOST their anchor/offset
//    controls (visibility, not display) so columns stay aligned — the
//    "name field ate the row" report was the layout collapsing into
//    the vacancy left by display:none.
// Version 0.7.0 — "the exit-checklist release"
// 0.7.0:
//  · DECISION MODAL v2 (D57): rows are LIVE (re-derived from real
//    state every render), ✓ completes the ACTIVE stage (the old code
//    completed the deadline stage — Jake's "still on the first phase"
//    bug), 🕐 replaces ↷ and reschedules the overdue DEADLINE to the
//    tier's next allowed day 9 AM, modal auto-closes when emptied.
//  · Collapsible project cards + pinned header buttons + finished
//    projects folded into their own section (D56).
//  · Un-complete-parent rewind modal, 3 options (D53).
//  · Duplicate-for-next-year: completion prompt + 🔁 card button (D59).
//  · Settings split into tabs; deadline hour (D51) + decision
//    threshold (D52) settable; per-tier allowed-day toggles (D60);
//    tier color conflict assistant (D55).
//  · ⓘ popover fix (D58): a tap inside a <label> re-dispatches a
//    click to the label's control, and THAT second click closed the
//    popover in the same instant it opened. preventDefault() stops
//    the forwarding. (Jake: "the i doesn't show anything.")
// 0.6.x: D50 undated stages, D49 versioned module imports, D43–D48
// priority engine v2 + modals + filters.

// ============================================================
// D101 — THE GESTURE LOCK.
//
// render() is a Firestore SNAPSHOT HANDLER (subscribeTasks/Projects/... all
// call it), not just a timer target. So a drag CANNOT simply skip renders:
// "if (dragging) return" would DISCARD a live update from Katie's phone, not
// postpone it, and silent-loss in a live-sync accountability app is a worse
// bug than the one being fixed. It defers and flushes instead.
//
// Scope check first: the drags already SURVIVE a mid-drag re-render by
// design — listeners are on document (D73) and the ghosts are body-level
// fixed precisely so the minute tick can't hide them (D74). What actually
// breaks is cosmetic: the .dragging dim resets and the preview snaps. So
// this is a polish fix with a correctness trap inside it, which is exactly
// why it gets a real mechanism instead of a one-liner.
//
// THE SAFETY VALVE: if a pointerup is ever lost (browser quirk, a tab
// backgrounded mid-drag, a pointercancel that never lands), a stuck lock
// would silently freeze live sync FOREVER — the app would look fine and
// quietly stop being true. That is unacceptable in this app specifically, so
// tick() force-clears any gesture older than 30s. No real drag lasts 30
// seconds; a lock that does is a bug, and it fails OPEN.

// year-bar moves/stretches and clock-estimate grips. Native undo inside
// text fields is untouched (the handler steps aside for inputs).
// D116 — two stacks, full redo. Every entry carries BOTH directions,
// captured at commit time when before and after are both in hand. A new
// action forks history: the redo stack dies (the old future is gone).
// EXCLUDED on principle, argued to Jake and accepted: completion toggles —
// checking a task fires celebrations, materializes follow-ups, spawns
// cacti, and UN-checking already owns a richer undo (the D53 oops/rewind/
// keep modal). A silent Ctrl-Z bypassing those semantics would be worse.
